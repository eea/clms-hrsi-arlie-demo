# HR Snow &amp; Ice - ARLIE demo
clms_hrsi_arlie_demo is a Python based tool to introduce you to the use of the Aggregated River and Lake Ice Extent (ARLIE) product. The ARLIE product is hosted on a PostGIS database and can be accessed through a REST API (via 2 remote procedure calls). The notebook demonstrates how to use this API to download ice statistics, read, manipulate and visualize the data with the help of Python. It also illustrates how the data can be manipulated using QGIS software.
